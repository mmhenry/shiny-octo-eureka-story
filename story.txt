Her name was Generic CS400Student. She was living in an apartment in Madison, in the middle of campus. It was very close to the Humanities building where her CS400 lecture took place. She was extremely happy about this because it meant a short walk to her favorite class. One day, she was bitten by a radioactive spider that made her really good at coding, and now she owns Google.^O

It happens when Generic was walking to her class, give a speech to her *previous* classmates. She was little late, so she started to run and ouch! She collide with a guy named Imapple Guy, who also good at coding and owns Apple.

After some yelling and arguing, a raggedy man with dirty clothes and missing teeth came 
up and joined in the argument.  He said that he "invented" linux.  The owners of Google 
and Apple stopped hollering and started laughing together at the raggedy linux guy.

After they finished laughing. The raggedy linux guys invited them to his office, but they
refused his offer and went home. Generic then decuded to drop out of UW-Madison so she
could focus on the company.
