Her name was Generic CS400Student. She was living in an apartment in Madison, in the middle of campus. It was very close to the Humanities building where her CS400 lecture took place. She was extremely happy about this because it meant a short walk to her favorite class. One day, she was bitten by a radioactive spider that made her really good at coding, and now she owns Google.^O
